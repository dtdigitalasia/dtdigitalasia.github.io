<p align="justify">Google recently launched its new keyboard for iOS users- Gboard. And like after each of its service launch, the marketing world delved itself to ponder ‘will it or will it not?’ Will the new keyboard have any impact on Google’s SEO or not? While the engineers at this giant tech company sorted few things out, the rest was quickly figured out by top SEO company in Shanghai and around. Gboard affects SEO and now marketers need to find ways how to capitalize on it for better ROI.<br><br>
But before we jump on to discuss the nitty-gritty of it, let’s first talk why it is important in the first place and why you- a brand- should care about it.<br><br> 
<b>iOS reach in the global market is huge</b><br><br>
Apple’s products’ reach in the consumer market is not a secret. Millions of people use apple devices- iMac, iPad, iPhones and more. This keyboard is available on iOS handheld devices, so that’s what you should focus on more. 
Let’s talk facts. In USA alone, there are over 101 million iPhone users (note this is just ‘iPhones’ and not other handheld devices). In USA and Canada, iPhone hold 52.3 per cent of Smartphone market. In 2014-15, the sales of iPhone increased by 11 per cent. These numbers states two things-<br><br>
<ul>
<li>There are over millions of internet users who access web via iOS devices; meaning, they now use Gboard (provided they have downloaded the app).</li><br><br>
<li>So, if Gboard affects Google SEO, you should get quite serious about it.</li><br><br>
</ul>
<b>How Gboard affects SEO?</b><br><br>
Simply put, Gboard keyboard allows for Google search from the board itself. So the result you will see on this will somewhat differ from the SERPs on your phone browser and Web Google Chrome. How does this affects the SEO? 
Well the engineers at Google said the search engine use the same algorithm, but there has been some very evident changes on the SERP that SEO company in Shanghai and around should take note. Here are three important things that you will notice- (Note- the app is at its initial stage. As we go, assumingly, there will lot more updates to it that will not only affect SEO but also make the social media agency Shanghai and around rethink their strategies.)<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Prioritizing news items- We all know Google love latest updates and newsy items. But on Gboard they have taken this to a whole different level. A search query will yield you with plenty of latest blogs or articles in horizontal boxes.</li><br><br> 
<li>Local businesses will get help- SEO for local businesses have become very important lately with Google’s last year’s algorithm updates. But on Gboard, the SERP, in a way, helps the local businesses. The search result allows people to call or message the business with a single tap, and share the contact information of that particular business with other contacts quite easily. This means you must offer the correct NAP (Name, Address and Phone number), unless you want users to share your wrong contact details.</li><br><br>
<li>PPC promotion will be of no use- One of the things missing on SERPs are the sponsored results. And according to sources, Google has no plan to show advertisements to Gboard users anytime soon whatsoever. So you might want to rethink of your budget portion that goes in PPC campaigns.</li><br><br>
</ul>  
<b>Need to make changes in the Content marketing and PPC advertising</b><br><br> 
Google ‘over-prioritization’ of newsy items on Gboard SERP is the highlight here. It is something that makes changing content marketing strategy imperative. The businesses now must effectively and extensively use blog marketing with higher consistency. Quality has always been important on Google, but now the race of more content might begin again, at least for the sake of this app.<br><br> 
Also, if you must have noticed, Google, on its SERP, also shows relevant Tweets (Posts from Twitters). Although there are no proof as of yet that results on Gboard would list tweets, but since it’s looking for newsy items, we have reasons to believe that people will start seeing relevant tweets soon enough. This means, Social media agency Shanghai and of around the world will have a significant role to play.<br><br> 
Another noteworthy thing here is that, according to reports, Google might soon launch this app for the android users as well. If that happens, it would become rather essential for <a href="http://www.dtdigitalasia.com/">digital marketing agencies</a> to incorporate these changes brought about by Gboard in their overall marketing strategies.
